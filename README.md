Center Parcs Cottage Web Scraper

This repository contains a web scraper script written in Python that allows you to scrape cottage information from the Center Parcs website. The scraper collects data such as: 
- Title
- New price
- Old price
- Surface
- Arrival and return date
- Country
- Vacation parc
- Timestamp
- Discount in euro's and percent

Run the app.py program to run the webscraper with the front-webapplication that uses flask, if you just want to run the webscraper by it self run the webscraper_full.
The other python programmes are test webscrapers that I built.
